## ⚡ The Problem
Open Source is messy. You find a great library, but it's abandoned. You check the forks... there are 500 of them.
* Which one is active?
* Which one fixed that critical bug?
* Which one is just a "readme update"?

**GitHub's default list view is useless for this. You need a map.**

---

## 🦄 What is ForkLens?
ForkLens is a **visual explorer** for GitHub repositories. It transforms a boring list of forks into an **interactive, galaxy-style graph**.

### 🎨 Key Features
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌌 Galaxy View** | Visualize forks as a solar system. Active repos glow, dead ones fade. |
| **⏳ Timeline Mode** | See the history of forks linearly to spot the latest maintainers. |
| **⚡ Instant Search** | Paste `owner/repo` and get results in milliseconds via GraphQL. |
| **📸 Shareable Cards** | Generate OG images for your own repo to show off activity. |
| **🧠 Smart Sorting** | Automatically flags "Active" vs "Stale" based on commit history. |

## 🔥 Why You Need This (The Secret Sauce)
*Instead of asking you to contribute, here is how you can use ForkLens to dominate:*

### 🕵️‍♂️ For Recruiters & Headhunters
**Stop reading resumes. Start reading code activity.**
ForkLens is a secret weapon for finding hidden talent. Plug in a popular but abandoned library (like `request` or `moment`). ForkLens instantly visualizes the **5 people in the world** who are actively maintaining their own forks.
* **These are your Senior Engineers.**
* **These are your passionate problem solvers.**
* **Hire them.**

### 👨‍💻 For Maintainers
**Show off your community.**
Embed a ForkLens badge in your own README. Show the world that your project is a living, breathing ecosystem, not just a static repo.
